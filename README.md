# MultipleObjectTracking
Created a basic paint application in VC++ that allowed the user to draw on a canvas using only gestures. Our application can track the position of the marker and applied curve generation algorithms to generate smooth drawings. The application also allows the user to zoom in/out by pinch in/out gestures using markers. We used OPENCV library for image processing.
